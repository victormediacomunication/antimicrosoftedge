THIS PROGRAM HELP TO DELETE MICROSOFT EDGE
####
How to install
1. Copy [ noedge.exe ] to `C:\Windows\System32`
2. Right click on file and in properties uncheck [unblock]
3. Run cmd as administrator
Type
`$ noedge -g`
Now this program ask you to enter Version Code of Microsoft Edge for this
open setting and search for App Manager and find the version of app
after this the program will ask you to clear cache so the cache are located to `%TEMP%` folder so it will be up to you for deletion but I recommend it to clean your computer of potential useless stuff

_Advert‚ö†Ô∏è_
first of all the antivirus must be deactivated then the program must be opened
once finished reactivate the antivirus and you can safely delete `noedge.exe` from the folder 
where it was inserted if you should have any doubts
I recommend an AntiVirus scan
